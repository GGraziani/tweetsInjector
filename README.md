# tweetsInjector

##How to use:

- Before running the app how should have a Neo4j Graph running and with the following configuration:
    
    url = "bolt://localhost:7687"; (alternatively this can be changed in the file "ConnectService.java")   
    user = "neo4j"   
    password = "1234"   
    
- Open the project using IntellijIDEA (also Eclipse should work) and then run the main method in "src/main/java/ch/usi/si/msde/ddm/tweetsinjector/app/App.java".
